Privacy Policy for Perplexity Shortcut

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. It only uses the permissions necessary to function:

- "activeTab" to interact with the current tab
- "storage" to save user preferences
- "scripting" to inject the search functionality
- "contextMenus" to add a right-click menu option

The extension sends search queries directly to Perplexity.ai. We do not intercept, store, or process these queries in any way.

For any questions or concerns about privacy, please submit an issue on this page: https://github.com/vaeho/Perplexity_Shortcut/issues
